# Abstraction (10%)

Here you should describe how you have used Inheritance for Code Reuse in your solution.

You should use class diagrams and code snippets where appropriate.

Here is an example of a code snippet in markdown

within my project i have used abstraction by using logical statements and seperating everything into its own classes. with each class exposing what it needs to function essecialy.

Membership:
```cs

```
the "items2 that are "hidden" are simoly runnun in the back ground until iti is calles by the rest of the system ir a state has change, members been stored or validated.

```
```

A great example is how i have separated the staff and general staff with encapsulating roles and responsibilities to play.
```cs


```
