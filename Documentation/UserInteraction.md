# User Interaction (10%)

You should use a reusable, object oriented menu system to manage user interaction. It should not be possible to crash the program with invalid or unexpected user input.

to manage the user interaction side of the capstone project, implemented a modular OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Menus System. With each major function of the system's ticket sales, concessions, scheduling and staff management all being accessible through clearly identifiable and labelled menus. I designed it by imagining the interface in the console to begin with, for example, i envisaged how the program would flow. 

To Simulate follow the console:

```cs

```
