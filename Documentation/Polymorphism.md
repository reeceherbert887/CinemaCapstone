# Polymorphism (10%)

Here you should describe how you have used Polymorphism in your solution.

You should use class diagrams and code snippets where appropriate.

Here is an example of a code snippet in markdown


I gahave used Polymorphsm to provide a flexible stand point for working with differentr staff roles, memberships and transactions as a whole. 2 examples of polymorphism in use would be my Manager and General staff classes. As both inherit from a common base class, botj share an interface which allows me to use all members of staff simultainsuly together.  


Example Code:
```cs

```

again not true polymophism but the basis is there for improvement...
