# Selling Tickets Workflow (10%)

In the workflow sections you must give clear instructions as to how to perform this workflow in your applcation. Use images and diagrams where necessary. Failure to give adequate instructions here may result in loss of marks.

This workflow should do the following things:


To Simulate: The Sign in section is only for pre defined customers (members) i have imported from the file "PreMember.txt". 
i have it set up ins stead of throuing an exceiption or crashing the system you will have to enter valid details to continue.
- Load information about the cinema without allowing invalid data
```cs

```
- To Simulate: Again as before but if the user presses "0" it will exit the is system, this was a left over debugging feature that i kept just in case.
- Load information about the schedule of screenings without allowing invalid data

```

- 
```cs

```

- Demonstrate the number of tickets available has updated
- 
- Save updated information about screenings
